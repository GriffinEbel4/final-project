# final-project
My initial plan for this game was to creat a basic 2d survival shooter with a medieval theme. I wanted to make it a sort of castle defence, but I could not find a backgrounf that worked well for that

While I failed to make it as advanced as I hoped, I still feel like I succeded in creating a fun but simple medieval shooter

The next features I would add to this game would be a life system and enemies that speed up as your score increases in order to make it progressively harder
